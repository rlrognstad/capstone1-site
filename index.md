## Predicting (and preventing) traffic fatalities

**Problem:** Tens of thousands of people are killed in vehicle-related crashes every year in the United States. Fatalities on US highways in 2015 increased by 7.2% from 2014 to 35092 individuals. The goal of this project is to analyze traffic fatality and supporting data to identify spatial patterns and factors that are related to fatal traffic incidents. Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of these crashes could inform state and local planners and law enforcement to reduce fatalities by changing infrastructure patterns, local regulations, or driver training.

This project is interesting to state and local planners, law enforcement, and driving instructors. This results will identify communities that are at higher risk of fatal crashes and also identify contributing risk factors likely to be involved, such as speeding, intoxicated driving, and adverse weather. These insights could inform targeted campaigns to reduce the risk factors or help police preparation.

**Dataset(s):** The main dataset is the US Department of Transportation traffic fatalities dataset( [FARS](https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/2015-traffic-fatalities-data-has-just-been-released-call-action-download-and-analyze) )
There is lots of potential to combine other datasets like OpenStreetView, driving behaviour from StreetLight Data or Waze, population data from census, possibly data on speed limits or other traffic laws/regulations. Weather data as it could be interesting because it is related to visibility and other physical driving conditions.

**Main question(s):** What spatial trends exist in the traffic fatality prevalence data? How are these trends related to predictor variables (weather conditions, traffic conditions, road/infrastructure, etc.)?
