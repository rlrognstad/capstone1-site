## Predicting (and preventing) traffic fatalities

**Problem:** Tens of thousands of people are killed in vehicle-related crashes every year in the United States. Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of these crashes could inform state and local planners and law enforcement to reduce fatalities by changing infrastructure patterns, local regulations, or driver training.

**Dataset(s):** Main dataset is US Department of Transportation traffic fatalities dataset: [FARS](https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/2015-traffic-fatalities-data-has-just-been-released-call-action-download-and-analyze) 
There is lots of potential to combine other datasets like OpenStreetView, driving behaviour from StreetLight Data or Waze, population data from census, possibly data on speed limits or other traffic laws/regulations. Weather data as it could be interesting because it is related to visibility and other physical driving conditions.

**Main question(s):** What spatial trends exist in the traffic fatality prevalence data? How are these trends related to predictor variables (weather conditions, traffic conditions, road/infrastructure, etc.)?
